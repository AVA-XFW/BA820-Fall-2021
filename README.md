> NOTE: I reserve the right to modify the syllabus at any time at my discretion.


## Requirements

- BU-associated Google account
- Google Cloud Account setup and any appropriate projects created (The syllabus has a code for $50 of GCP credits for this course)
- A python coding environment where you are able to install packages.  This could be Colab or a local coding environment like VS Code.

## Setup

- We will be using Big Query for our datasets this semester.  For ease-of-use, you may want to pin the dataset (i.e. database) that will have the tables for our work.  The dataset/tables are available via `questrom.datasets`.  __PRIOR TO CLASS__ you should have tested that you can access the tables.  For example, count the number of records in the `diamonds` table.

> Should you have any issues, please post issues to our Forums on Questrom Tools.  Also, a friendly reminder per above to use the code in the syllabus to redeem your GCP credits affiliated with this course.
